        * [ADDED]: Full Foreign Keys altering support - when modifying table, foreign keys will follow table changes.
        * [ADDED]: Support for system tables in table window -> they can be viewed but cannot be modified (SQLite itself prevents that).

        * [ADDED]: Form view of data has now resizable fields (but only for TEXT, BLOB and similar datatypes), so you can see more data at once instead of scrolling a lot.
        * [ADDED]: Grid row (table data grid or query results grid) can select whole row at once by clicking on ROWNUM column or by Control-click on any cell. (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=208)

        * [ADDED]: Defining order of databases in the list by Drag&Drop of databases.
        * [ADDED]: Drag&Drop of databases and objects between databases. Now you can copy/move tables (also indexes, triggers and views) between databases simply by D&D. It's possible even between SQLite3 and SQLite2 databases!
        * [ADDED]: When modifying a table, all views that reference the table are adjusted to the new form of table (new name, column changes, etc), just like indexes and triggers were adjusted so far.
        * [ADDED]: Help hint about parameters to SQL function in Custom SQL Functions dialog.
        * [ADDED]: Support for multiple value sets in INSERT statements (introduced in SQLite 3.7.11).

        * [CHANGE]: Table window opening speed up. Loading related triggers and indexes postponed to moment of displaying proper tab.
        * [CHANGE]: Displaying and editing huge data volumes (both in table window and SQL editor) is now supported much better and faster.
        * [CHANGE]: Memory usage for exporting minimized. Now it's possible to export any amount of data at once.

        * [CHANGE]: Introduced support for custom number of table constraints (not column constraints), so for example two or more primary keys defined as separated table constraints is now possible from table dialog. (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=200)
        * [CHANGE]: Trigger DDL support enhanced. Now it supports "UPDATE OF <columns>" statements.
        * [CHANGE]: Supported languages are now displayed in human readable form, by names, not by strange locale symbols.
        * [CHANGE]: Session management improoved. It's easier to write session-aware classes now.
        * [CHANGE]: Using thread pools instead of individual threads wherever it's possible. This made SQL editor windows to open a little quicker and to work more smoothly.
        * [CHANGE]: SQL Editor completion hints display "busy" animated icon if parsing some huge SQL takes a little longer.
        * [CHANGE]: Platform detecting code unified.
        * [CHANGE]: Parser and lexer classes enclosed in UniversalParser and UniversalLexer, preventing many potential memory leaks.
        * [CHANGE]: Switched from BEGIN to SAVEPOINT in most cases (only in SQLite3, in SQLite2 BEGIN usage remains).
        * [CHANGE]: Table grid view menu context reorganized to be more readable.
        * [CHANGE]: Changed icons for "Export table" and "Export database" to fit general schema of icons.
        * [CHANGE]: Enhanced layout of context hints for tables (table data and results data).
        * [CHANGE]: Auto-update checks directory permissions, so it allows automatic update only if privileges are sufficient.
        * [CHANGE]: Session saving now stores the full image of what objects were expanded or collapsed, so it gets fully restored.
        * [CHANGE]: Added shadows for hints under Windows.
        * [CHANGE]: Simplified bug reporting dialog.
        * [REMOVED]: Solaris binaries. Nobody seems to use them. Users still can run SQLiteStudio from sources with some Tcl distribution.
        * [BUGFIX]: Again improved performance for huge table data and huge query results.
        * [BUGFIX]: Column context information in table window fixed to display constraints correctly.
        * [BUGFIX]: Fixed virtual table exporting (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=201).

[2.0.0]
        * [ADDED]: Updates checking on startup.
        * [ADDED]: Real SQL parser based on lexer&parser pair! It provides many, many possibilities. Few of them are already implemented and listed in changelog below.
        * [ADDED]: (SQL parser stuff) SQL syntax validation on the fly with error markers.
        * [ADDED]: (SQL parser stuff) Enterprise SQL code formatter. It's very powerful and configurable, but works only on valid code, so if the SQL is marked to be incorrect (see paragraph above) then formatter won't format such SQL.
        * [ADDED]: Table columns can be edited directly from table window by double-clicking on them.
        * [ADDED]: Columns order in TableDialog can be now be managed by drag&drop.
        * [ADDED]: Possibility to display ROWID in table data view. Just right-click and pick it from context menu.
        * [ADDED]: Internal stuff: [final] procedure, so important internal variables are secured.
        * [ADDED]: Internal stuff: Introduced threads. GUI acts more shmoothly.
        * [ADDED]: Possibility to add database only for current session (it won't be on the list after application restart).

        * [ADDED]: Tasks order in taskbar at the bottom can now be managed using drag&drop.
        * [ADDED]: Progress bar for export dialog, populate dalog and table dialog (good to keep track on tasks done on tables with lots of data) with possibility to interrupt the process.
        * [ADDED]: Long query executions can be interrupted.
        * [ADDED]: Pending commits (with autocommit as option in configuration). User can modify some data (add, edit or delete rows) and commit them all togather at the end.
        * [ADDED]: Filter entry in form view of table data tab.
        * [ADDED]: Added "(filtered)" information next to "Total rows" in case of filtered table data view.

        * [ADDED]: New versions checking at startup or on demand and auto-upadte support for binary distributions.
        * [ADDED]: MacOS X port.

        * [CHANGE]: (SQL parser stuff) Smart completion hints - now SQLiteStudio knows better if next argument should be a keyword, or a table name, or index, name, etc. Moreover - object names (tables, indexes, etc) already used somewhere in the SQL query appear higher in completion hint, since user seems to be interested in them. It really kicks ass! Try it out!

        * [CHANGE]: Refreshing database schema doesn't collapse its branches.
        * [CHANGE]: Executing queries in SQL editor refreshes schema in databases tree, so all new, changed or deleted objects are noticed immediately.
        * [CHANGE]: Balloon hints appears now faster and allows to browse help hints for many widgets placed close to each other very quickly.
        * [CHANGE]: New icons.
        * [CHANGE]: Table window now displays all constraints in "Columns" tab as icons. Therefore "constraints" tab has been removed from table window.
        * [CHANGE]: More intuitive inserting data in form view.
        * [CHANGE]: Plain text results are now configurable (NULL representation, column width).

        * [BUGFIX]: Closing configuration window in other way than "cancel" or "ok" makes it close as for "cancel".
        * [BUGFIX]: (SQL parser stuff) Detecting symbolic database names (databases from objects tree) in SQL editor has been fixed, so table name same as database name won't be a problem anymore.

        * [BUGFIX]: Many, many, many other bug fixes not listed here, because I didn't write them down during fixing.
        * [BUGFIX]: Scrolling grids horizontally is now smooth.
        * [BUGFIX]: Added *(*autoindex*)* indexes of SQLite2 to list of system indexes, so they can be filtered out.
