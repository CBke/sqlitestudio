/**
 * @brief Base class for all query executor steps.
 *
 * Query Executor step is a single step that query executor performs at a time
 * during the "smart execution" (see QueryExecutor for details).
 *
 * Steps are created and queued in QueryExecutor::setupExecutionChain().
 * Order of steps execution is very important and should not be distrurbed,
 * unless you know what you're doing.
 *
 * A step must implement one method: exec().
 * The implementation can access QueryExecutor instance that is running the step
 * and also it can access common context for executor and all the steps.
 *
 * Steps usually introduce some modifications to the query, so the final execution
 * can provide more meta-information, or works on limited set of data, etc.
 *
 * Steps can access common context to get parsed object of the current query.
 * The current query is the query processed by previous steps and re-parsed after
 * those modifications. Current query is also available in a string representation
 * in the context. The original query string (before any modifications) is also
 * available in the context. See QueryExecutor::Context for more.
 *
 * QueryExecutorStep provides several methods to help dealing with common routines,
 * such as updating current query with modified query definition (updateQueries()),
 * or extracting parsed SELECT (if the last query defined was the SELECT) object
 * (getSelect()). When the step needs to add new result column, it can use
 * getNextColName() to generate unique name.
 *
 * To access database object, that the query is executed on, use QueryExecutor::getDb().
