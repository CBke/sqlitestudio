/**
 * @brief Database managed by application.
 *
 * Everything you might want to do with SQLite databases goes through this interface in the application.
 * It's has a common interface for common database operations, such as connecting and disconnecting,
 * checking current status, executing queries and reading results.
 * It keeps information about the database version, dialect (SQLite 2 vs SQLite 3), encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.),
 * symbolic name of the database and path to the file.
 *
 * Regular routine with the database object would be to open it (if not open yet), execute some query
 * and collect results. It can be done in several ways, but here's simple one:
 * @code
 * QList<int> queryDb(const QString& dbName, const QString& colValue1, int colValue2)
 * {
 *     // Getting database object by its name and opening it if necessary
 *     Db* db = DBLIST->getDb(dbName);
 *     if (!db)
 *         return; // no such database
 *
 *     if (!db->isOpen())
 *         db->open();
 *
 *     // Executing query and getting results
 *     SqlResultsPtr results = db->exec("SELECT intCol FROM table WHERE col1 = ?, col2 = ?", colValue1, colValue2)
 *
 *     QList<int> resultList;
 *     SqlResultsRowPtr row;
 *     while (row = results->next())
 *     {
 *         resultList << row->value("intCol").toInt();
 *     }
 *     return resultList;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The example above is very generic way to do things. You can use many methods which simplifies tasks in case
 * you work with smaller data sets. For example:
 * @code
 * int getRowId(Db* db, int colVal)
 * {
 *     // We assume that db is already open
 *     return db->exec("SELECT rowid FROM table WHERE column = ?", colVal).getSingleCell().toInt();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To write some data into database you can write as this:
 * @code
 * void insert(Db* db, const QString& val1, int val2)
 * {
 *     // We assume that db is already open
 *     db->exec("INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES (?, ?)", val1, val2);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can use named parameters:
 * @code
 * void insert(Db* db, const QString& val1, int val2)
 * {
 *     QHash<QString,QVariant> params;
 *     params["c1"] = val1;
 *     params["c2"] = val2;
 *     db->exec("INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES (:c1, :c2)", params);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To check if the execution was successful, test results:
 * @code
 * void insert(Db* db, const QString& val1, int val2)
 * {
 *     SqlResultsPtr results = db->exec("INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES (?, ?)", val1, val2);
 *     if (results->isError())
 *     {
 *         qWarning() << "Error while inserting:" << results->getErrorCode() << results->getErrorText();
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see DbBase
 * @see DbQt
 * @see DbQt2
 * @see DbQt3
